# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my TypeScript solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Each day's folder includes the code that was used to solve the respective challenge along with the test cases. Fair warning, quality varies between different solutions as this is purely for fun and learning.

## Usage

To run a specific day's solution, copy the example and your test input into example.txt and input.txt respectively, then run the following:

```bash

pnpm install
pnpm test 2023/day01

```

Replace 2023 and day01 with the appropriate date.

## Folder Structure

The repository structure is organized by year and days:

```css
